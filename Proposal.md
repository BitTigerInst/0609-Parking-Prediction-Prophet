# Description
The project challenge is provided by Smarking. We will predict the parking occupancy of each hour according to the three years data provided. Comparison will be made between the real data and the predicted one. To provide better user experience, a website will be used, which could allow users to upload CSV file of real data, and see the concretized comparison.  

# Plan
#### Todo List
  - display true/predicted data(UI)
  - 2-5 ways to display accuracy of prediction(UI)
  - time-period filter for people to choose(UI)
  - CSV upload(UI)
  - web back-end to support the web and call the predict.py automatically
  - data visualisation，feature extraction
  - 3-5 models for data predictiont
  
#### Timeline
| Week       |     Period     |  Goal |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:------:|
| 1 |  05/09/2016-11/09/2016 |Design API;Basic Front-End coding;Random Forest produces JSON (optional：data visualisation + feature analysis)|
| 2 | 12/09/2016-18/09/2016 | Design and implement UI; Use current JSON data; Choose Feature; Try 1-2 algorithm models |
| 3 | 19/09/2016-25/09/2016| Detailed features: Upload CSV, filter of time period; Back-End Server;Try 1-2 algorithm models |
| 4 | 26/09/2016-02/10/2016| Finish all which are mentioned above |
